# govalid - Go package for data validation

## Usage
```bash
go get github.com/pengux/govalid
```

To validate your data, you must implement the interface Validatable for the types that you want to validate. Checkout the file [`e2e_test.go`](https://github.com/pengux/govalid/blob/master/e2e_test.go) for example of how to use this package and also how to define your own validators.
